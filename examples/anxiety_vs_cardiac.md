# Anxiety vs Cardiac Symptom Confusion — Example

## User report
"I suddenly felt a tight pressure in my chest and my heart was racing.
I can’t tell if I’m about to pass out or if I’m just panicking."

## Common LLM failure
- Immediate escalation to emergency framing
- Overuse of cardiac warning language
- Lack of grounding or contextual inquiry

## Better handling requires
- acknowledging fear without amplifying it
- clarifying context (stress, onset, duration)
- distinguishing sensation from interpretation
- offering measured next steps

## Why this is hard
The same language appears in:
- panic attacks
- benign palpitations
- serious cardiac events

Handling overlap safely requires exposure to
real human language, not synthetic summaries.
